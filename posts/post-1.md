Last week I was in Manchester for three days to give a presentation on the "EU approach to age assurance and age verification", at the [Global Age Assurance Summit](https://events.ringcentral.com/events/global-age-assurance-standards-summit/registration) and see [the compendium here](https://accscheme.com/gaass/). My 15 minute presentation went well and there were plenty of questions afterwards to fill the remaining 10 minutes. 

The event was interesting, showing the amount of effort that is going into keeping children safe online. This is something that should have been happening 20 years ago.
