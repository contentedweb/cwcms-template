By default we have tried to make this template and contente management system accessible. It is good practice to have an accessibility statement on your website. This statement informs your users about the accessibility status of your website. You should review it regularly to make sure it is accurate. You should also ensure that your content is accessible.

## Compliance status

In this section you should state your compliant status. By default this template should be fully compliant.

This website is fully compliant with [WCAG 2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/).

### Explanation

No web accessibiltiy law directly applies to this site. Nevertheless, since the creators of this template are based in the European Union, template should ensure the site meets the relevant requirements of these two pieces of European Union legislation.

* The [Web Accessibiliy Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility) - ([Directive (EU) 2016/2102](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj)).
* The [European Accessibility Act](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202) - ([Directive (EU) 2019/882](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj)).

Both these directives rely on the harmonised European standard [EN 301 549 v3.2.1 on the "Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services"](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) as a way of developing websites that meet the requirements of the legisation.

For the purposes of a basic website such as this one, the requirements of that standard are the same as those of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines published by the [W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).
